# Benchmarks

## Appropedia

### What it is

> Appropedia is the site to develop and share collaborative solutions in sustainability, poverty reduction and international development through the use of sound principles and appropriate technology, original research and project information. We are a wiki, a type of website which allows anyone to add and edit content. In order to contribute, we only require a quick and simple registration.
> Sometimes, Appropedia has been described as an "appropriate technology wiki," but it is much broader than that —it is a green living wiki for all matters of international development and aid. Appropedia is an open site for stakeholders to come together to find, create and improve scalable and adaptable solutions. This can include sharing information and collaborating with others on how we can lighten our ecological footprint and live in harmony with nature and our environment in developed countries, or discuss eg low cost technologies for use in the developing world. A key aim of Appropedia is to provide this information, to support sustainable choices - sharing knowledge to build rich, sustainable lives.

## Open Know-How

### What it is

> Open Know-How is all about sharing how to make things. With dozens of open hardware organisations and over 80 content-hosting platforms and thousands of designers sharing open hardware designs there is little consistency as to how know-how is documented or shared. Makers struggle to locate what they need, not knowing which platform to find it, what the intended use is and therefore struggle to adapt designs. Whilst the knowledge is ‘open’ is not freely flowing in the spirit that open-ness suggests.

## Matalog

### What it is

> Matalog has the ambition of crowdsourcing a global repository of material information to create an open access material library that houses the profiles of materials used by architects, builders, designers, makers, artists and artisans around the world.

## Instructables

### What it is

> The seeds of Instructables germinated at the MIT Media Lab as the future founders of Squid Labs built places to share their projects, connect with others, and make an impact on the world. One of these early places was a blog Zeroprestige, which was an open source hardware experiment for kitesurfing. Here they documented their hand-sewn kites, plywood boards, and other general mayhem that happens when PhDs and high winds collide.
> As a result of freely sharing our work, we met a ton of great people, received great opportunities, and were smacked in the face with the need for a web-based documentation system.
> Instructables became that documentation system in 2005, as an in-house project of Squid Labs. When they weren't solving interesting problems like solar panels for driveways, efficiently harnessing human power, or strain sensing ropes, you could find them sharing Instructables from the workshop. From cooking to 3d printing, to making just about anything fly, Instructables became the recipient of countless hours of tinkering, soldering, stitching, frying, and fun, making just about anything.
> Instructables was officially spun out of Squid Labs in the summer of 2006, and has gone on to grow from a modest hundreds of projects to over one hundred thousand. The community that now calls the site home, is an amazing mix of wonder from around the world. Every day we continue to be amazed by the imagination, curiosity, and simple awesomeness of everyone who shares their creations with us on Instructables.

## ThinkWiki

### What it is

> This is ThinkWiki, the Wikipedia for IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad users. In here, you can find anything you need to install your favourite Linux distribution on your ThinkPad. Windows users shouldn't run away, there's a lot of useful information for them as well. Some Linux information for Mac users also can be found here.

## Thingiverse

### What it is

> MakerBot's Thingiverse is a thriving design community for discovering, making, and sharing 3D printable things. As the world's largest 3D printing community, we believe that everyone should be encouraged to create and remix 3D things, no matter their technical expertise or previous experience. In the spirit of maintaining an open platform, all designs are encouraged to be licensed under a Creative Commons license, meaning that anyone can use or alter any design.

## Open Repair Data Standard

### What it is

> The Open Repair Data Standard (ORDS) defines a shared approach towards collecting and sharing repair data about small electricals and electronics. The goal of this standard is to make it easy to combine open data on electronics repair that has been collected by many different groups.

## Open3R

### What it is

> This household waste recycling centre (HWRC) open data standard is a standard which describes information about HWRCs, and is being designed to provide guidance to local authorities on publishing data about HWRCs. Data such as opening times, the services that are offered by a HWRC A data standard makes data better for users, because it means that different publishers, with different data capture and publishing systems, can publish data in the same format. This means it is much easier to stick two publisher's datasets together. If everyone publishes their data to the standard, then it is theoretically possible to have a dataset that covers the whole of the UK. This dataset could then be used to power a Where's My Nearest Recycling Centre app, or support time-to-travel analyses for recycling centres.

## Persistent Things

### What it is

> Self-sovereign Matter proposes the design of objects that have an inherent disposition to persevere, encouraging the creation of repair economies. To achieve this, objects could be self-executing—using smart contracts and IoT technologies, objects could self-monitor their performance and send notifications when in need of repair, creating a demand and incentivising hacking and repairing. At a second level, products could be self-owning; that is, the decision to be hacked, repaired, adapted or reused belongs to the object and cannot be overwritten by the economic interests of other actors in the production system.

## WasteNet

### What it is

> [T]he world’s largest dataset for waste, holding over 2.5 million training images created by deep learning and computer vision.
These datasets are refined by weight and brand-level detection enabled through [Recycleye’s vision system](https://recycleye.com/artificial-intelligence-total-waste/).
