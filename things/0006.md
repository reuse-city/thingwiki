## Stories

### Felipe Schmidt Fonseca:

> 2021-09-22 - This multifunctional was lying outside of my former home in Berlin, with a sign saying "Zu verschenken" (to donate). I got it upstairs, cleaned it and tested the scanner, which was working just great. I had to buy ink cartridges and perform a clean and align, using the printer's menu. It's been perfect since.
