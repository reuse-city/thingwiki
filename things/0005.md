## Stories

### Felipe Schmidt Fonseca:

> 2021-09-22 - I got this scooter for free a couple of months ago from a private person via eBay Kleinanzeigen in Berlin. It was not working that well. It seems the bearings of the steering, well, part (no idea how that's called), were failing. Making curves is not that smooth. The height is not easily adjusted, as the previous owner has used a bolt to fasten it. It seems the original spring wasn't working anymore. We have another scooter of this same model in the family, also found on Kleinanzeigen but that one I paid some euros to get. In that case, the folding mechanism was replaced by a fixed bolt (which makes it impossible to fold). I'm not sure how much these two products were used. The wheels are not that bad. Based on my extremely small sample though, I can infer that the articulated / moving / adjustable parts of this scooter are not as good as its structure.
