## Stories

### Felipe Schmidt Fonseca:

> - 2021-09-22 - I bought this electric coffee grinder from a stall at the Boxhagener Platz fleamarket for what seemed to be a good price. Only it turns out it did not work.
> - 2021-10-18 - The product case uses triangle-shaped screws, a minor annoyance. I opened it looking for replaceable fuses, to no avail. To go deeper in opening it would require philips screwdriver than the ones I have. I'll need to return to it later.
