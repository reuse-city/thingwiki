## Story

### Felipe Schmidt Fonseca:

I bought this very cheap in a Fleamarket in Berlin. It doesn't even turn on. I tried using a different cable and replacing the fuse, to no avail. It requires more work. I tried contacting product support following the official channels. The attendant replied to my email asking for proof of purchase, which I did not have. I asked for service manuals, schematics or any other technical information, but the attendant said they couldn't send me none.
