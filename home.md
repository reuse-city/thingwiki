## About

![thingwiki-logo.png](/thingwiki-logo.png =500x){.align-center}

This website is a prototype of the design concept called [Universal Registry of Things](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things), created by Felipe Schmidt Fonseca as part of his ongoing PhD research at the [OpenDoTT project](https://opendott.org).

More information about ThingWiki and the Universal Registry of Things can be found on Felipe's [research blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott).

The data in this website is automatically synchronised with [this public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/reuse-city/thingwiki).
